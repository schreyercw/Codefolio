# Objectives of a C# Console Application with Entity Framework Core

The objectives of a C# console application with Entity Framework Core, IDbContextFactory, Providers, SqlServer, InMemory, Sqlite, Entity Modeling, CLI to generate SqlServer and Sqlite database, and Unit testing with InMemory and Sqlite database can be summarized as follows:

## 1. Implement Entity Framework Core

One of the primary objectives of the application is to implement Entity Framework Core to interact with a database. Entity Framework Core is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that provides an abstraction over the database, allowing the application to interact with the database without writing SQL queries.

## 2. Use IDbContextFactory

The application should use IDbContextFactory to create instances of the application's DbContext. This allows the application to decouple the DbContext creation from the dependency injection system and provides a way to create a new DbContext instance every time it's needed.

## 3. Use Providers

The application should use providers to specify which database management system the application should use to store data. Entity Framework Core supports multiple database providers, including SqlServer, InMemory, and Sqlite.

## 4. Use Entity Modeling

The application should use Entity Modeling to define the database schema and to create entities that represent tables in the database. This involves creating C# classes that map to database tables and defining their relationships and constraints.

## 5. Use CLI to Generate SqlServer and Sqlite Database

The application should use the command-line interface (CLI) to generate the SqlServer and Sqlite databases based on the Entity Modeling. The CLI allows the application to create a new database and to apply migrations to the database schema as changes are made to the Entity Modeling.

## 6. Use Unit Testing with InMemory and Sqlite Database

The application should use unit testing to test its Entity Framework Core functionality. The application should create unit tests that use InMemory and Sqlite databases to ensure that the application's interactions with the database are working correctly.

In summary, a C# console application with Entity Framework Core, IDbContextFactory, Providers, SqlServer, InMemory, Sqlite, Entity Modeling, CLI to generate SqlServer and Sqlite database, and Unit testing with InMemory and Sqlite database can achieve objectives such as implementing Entity Framework Core, using IDbContextFactory, using Providers, using Entity Modeling, using the CLI to generate SqlServer and Sqlite database, and using Unit Testing with InMemory and Sqlite database to ensure that the application's interactions with the database are working correctly.

## CLI commands
- dotnet ef database update --project MyApplication --startup-project MyApplication --context MyDbContext --verbose --connection "connection string goes here" --provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet ef database update --project MyApplication --startup-project MyApplication --context MyDbContext --verbose --connection "connection string goes here" --provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
