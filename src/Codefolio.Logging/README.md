# Objectives of a C# Console Application with Logging

The objectives of a C# console application with Logging, AddLogging, Logging levels configuration, Constructor injection of ILogger<TCategoryName>, SeriLog, and Sinks can be summarized as follows:

## 1. Implement Logging

One of the primary objectives of the application is to implement logging to record information about its execution. The application should use logging to capture errors, warnings, and other relevant information during runtime.

## 2. Use AddLogging to Configure Logging

The application should use the built-in AddLogging extension method to configure logging in the application. This method adds logging services to the application's service collection, allowing the application to use logging functionality throughout its code.

## 3. Configure Logging Levels

The application should configure logging levels to specify which log messages are recorded based on their severity. The application should be able to configure logging levels for individual loggers or for the entire application.

## 4. Use Constructor Injection of ILogger<TCategoryName>

The application should use Constructor Injection of ILogger<TCategoryName> to inject loggers into its classes. This allows the application to log messages from any class without having to manually create and manage logger instances.

## 5. Use SeriLog for Logging

The application should use SeriLog, a third-party logging library, to handle logging functionality. SeriLog provides powerful features such as structured logging, filtering, and logging sinks.

## 6. Use Logging Sinks

The application should use logging sinks to direct log messages to different outputs such as files, databases, or message queues. This allows the application to log messages in a variety of formats and to different destinations depending on its requirements.

## 7. Improve Debugging and Troubleshooting

By implementing logging, the application can improve its debugging and troubleshooting capabilities. Log messages can be used to trace the flow of the application and to diagnose errors and issues during runtime.

In summary, a C# console application with Logging, AddLogging, Logging levels configuration, Constructor injection of ILogger<TCategoryName>, SeriLog, and Sinks can achieve objectives such as implementing logging, using AddLogging to configure logging, configuring logging levels, using Constructor Injection of ILogger<TCategoryName>, using SeriLog for logging, using logging sinks, and improving debugging and troubleshooting capabilities.
